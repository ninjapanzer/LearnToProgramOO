Rock Paper Scissors the Ruby Way.

Since our target here is to learn the OO way of doing things and we all know how the game RPS works we should use that as a basis for some exporation on how our code works.

Here are the tools you will need.

The code from this chapter

RUBY

Editor - Notepad++ SublimeText2 TextMate Whatever!

Assignment - Identify the responsibilities and possible objects that are needed to play RPS. These can vary from my solution but you should be able to explain your design patterns

Hands On - We will step through and evaluate the top level structure of the program. Do not be upset if you do not understand all parts of the program yet. We are going to work with this for a while and for now I want you to be able to read and understand how to follow the code flow and identify the SRP within each object.

Aside from OO theory we are going to cover general control statements and explore assignment to variables.

If you read this code before our session try to take it in small chunks. Evaluate the methods in your mind or on paper before trying to evaluate the class as a whole.

Methods start def <some name> followed by an end on the same line.

At this point feel free to clone this into your own github and prepare for some future assignments which will require making changes to this application when we evaluate the next OO topic of "bindings"
